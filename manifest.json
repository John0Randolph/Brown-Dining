/**
 * Brown Dining Alert, version 1.0
 * 2019
 * project of John Randolph
 *
 * Design questions:
 * - do we want to say the time of the food as 'lunch' or as 11-2?
 * - communicate with a sinlge tile each morning + list onclick
 * - how to deal with no wifi
 *
 * Design to implement:
 * - scrape.js: once a day, on certain time (or first time when laptop is opened), clear popup.html + use function in background to update foods on popup.html
 * - background.js:
 *    - function to grab list of foods to look for from local service
 *    - function to for each page, scrape it and grab if food appears in it for all food. save data to local data and push alerts
